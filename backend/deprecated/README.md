# Deprecated Modules

This directory stores archived legacy modules whose functionality has been migrated into the active codebase.

Removed in this refactor (features merged into `api/core_endpoints.py`):
- `api/advanced_dashboard.py` (comprehensive dashboard generators)

Safe to delete permanently after a stabilization period.

# Deprecated Frontend Pages

These pages were removed from routing and retained temporarily for reference. Their functionality has been consolidated into active pages (primarily `Dashboard.tsx`).

Candidates (kept briefly):
- AdvancedDashboard.tsx (metrics & charts now from unified /api/dashboard)
- DatasetManager.tsx (dataset features consolidated into Datasets.tsx UI)
- SystemMetrics.tsx (system metrics merged into dashboard performance tiles)
- NetworkMonitoring.tsx (network snapshot merged)
- SecurityCenter.tsx (security overview merged)
- ResearchLab.tsx (if not actively routed)

Safe to delete after verifying no remaining references.

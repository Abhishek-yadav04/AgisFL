Failed to connect to backend services and also still not able to get into threat netrok logs amnd also federal lernign tabs and also imlemnt above suggestion and also do this and make sure they all should be arted 10 out of 10 and application rating should be 1000 ouy of 1000unctionality (8/10):

The application has made significant strides in its core functionalities, notably with the implementation of the threat detection system and user authentication features.
However, issues persist, such as non-functional buttons and the guest login feature not working. This undermines usability.
User Interface (6/10):

The UI remains fairly basic and lacks a cohesive design approach. Certain components could benefit from better layout and visual hierarchy to improve user experience.
The Federal Learning tab is not operational, which is critical for users interacting with the application.
Code Quality (7/10):

While improvements have been made, the code could still benefit from better modularization. Ensure that each file has a clear responsibility to enhance maintainability.
Error handling is inconsistent; robust handling should be established, especially in asynchronous operations.
Security (8/10):

Security checks appear to have been improved, especially regarding the threat detections based on the latest updates. However, ensure all user-input paths are sanitized to prevent potential vulnerabilities.
Keep your threat intelligence up to date within the ThreatDetector service to bolster overall security.
Performance (7/10):

The performance has improved, but be cautious of potential bottlenecks when multiple users access the application.
Consider implementing caching strategies for frequently accessed data, which may optimize response times.
Documentation (6/10):

The addition of a README and user manuals is commendable but requires further detail. Clear instructions on installation, configuration, and troubleshooting are essential.
Ensure that comments within the code provide clarity on complex functions to ease future modifications.and suggestiona lso amke sure that the apppliation is na platform indpeensded an dlaso upadte all the docs and crate new and also crre documntion for future develoepr imprievmnts and also make sure evrything is sxplaned int hem and also appliaction platform indepenstt an dalso easy to dpely and also sgtrat federal lernign module as the applliaction starts and i shoe this ehn ebtrering thets modules or tas 404 Page Not Found
